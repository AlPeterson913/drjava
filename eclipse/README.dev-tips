DrJava Plug-in for Eclipse Development Tips -----

Building:
 - The ant script currently is not configured to build the correct source tree,
   so either update it to do so or build by hand, in Eclipse:
     - Choose File->Export, and select "Deployable Features"
     - Export the InteractionsPaneFeature project (you'll also need InteractionsPane
       in the workspace) to an archive file or a directory
     - Copy the contents of the plugins and features folders generated to your
       Eclipse installation folder (usually "eclipse").

How to run the plug-in tests:

 - The tests create Eclipse objects, which require extra libraries.
   There is currently no ant target for running the plug-in tests,
   so it's best to run them by hand.
 - To do:
   - Add instructions for specifying these libraries to this document.


How to add a preference to the plug-in:

 - Add a constant to DrJavaConstants
 - In DrJavaPreferencePage:
   - Add a field in createFieldEditors()
 - Add a default value to EclipsePlugin
 - Add an IPropertyChangeListener to the PreferenceStore
   (EclipsePlugin.getDefault().getPreferenceStore())
   - Specifically, in InteractionsController:
     - Add a variable to remember preference
     - Make action dependent on variable
     - Add a line to _updatePreferences


 Special note for font preferences:
  - Fonts are added to FontRegistry in plugin.xml (via an extension point)
  - Use JFaceResources to access the FontRegistry
    (see InteractionsController, InteractionsView)
