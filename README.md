Branches for integration and releases

The drscala branch is the current DrScala repo.
The develop branch is a variant of the drscala branch, so I expected to see it below drscala in the branch hierarchy 
rather than beside it.
I clearly don't understand github very well.
I build DrJava and (local) DrScala releases frame this code base but I upload distribute them through Sourceforge.
