DrJava Plug-in for Eclipse


About ----
  This plug-in for IBM's Eclipse platform integrates features from the 
DrJava development environment.  The plug-in provides an Interactions Pane 
and a simplified user interface for new users.


Installation ----
  Copy this directory into the "plugins" directory of your Eclipse 
installation.  After you restart Eclipse, DrJava will appear in the list 
of available Perspectives.  (Window->Open Perspective->Other...)


Important Note, version 0.0.1 ----
  This is a *pre-release* of the DrJava Plug-in for Eclipse, and should 
only be used for testing.  The Java interpreter currently runs in the same 
Java Virtual Machine as Eclipse, so typing "while (true);" will cause 
Eclipse to become unresponsive.  The first actual release of the DrJava 
Plug-in for Eclipse will run the Java interpreter in a separate Java 
Virtual Machine.
