How to set up your environment to develop on DrJava
by Brian Stoler (bstoler@rice.edu)

1) Get SourceForge.net account and get added to the DrJava group.

2) Make a directory to be the top-level container of DrJava stuff. I recommend
   "sf", for SourceForge.

3) Set CVSROOT environment variable to "user@cvs.drjava.sf.net:/cvsroot/drjava",
   substitution your SourceForge account name for user.

4) Set CVS_RSH environment variable to "ssh"

5) cd ~/sf

6) cvs -d $CVSROOT checkout src

7) Install Ant: http://jakarta.apache.org/ant

8) Download the JSR-14 prototype compiler (with generics) from
   http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/adding_generics.
   Then unzip the file you downloaded, and move the included javac.jar to
   ~/sf/src/edu/rice/cs/lib/jsr14.jar.

9) Set CLASSPATH environment variable to include all of the following:
   * ~/sf/built (this is where compiled classes will go)
   * ~/sf/src/edu/rice/cs/lib/jsr14.jar
   * ~/sf/src/edu/rice/cs/lib/junit.jar
   * ~/sf/src/edu/rice/cs/lib/GJv6.jar
   * ~/sf/src/edu/rice/cs/lib/gj-util.jar
   * ~/sf/src/edu/rice/cs/lib/dynamicjava.jar

That should be it! Make sure all the environment variables are exported if
you're using UNIX. Of course you'll probably want to set them from within
a script or your .bashrc or .cshrc or whatever.

One other possible thing: If you ever get an OutOfMemoryError when compiling
or testing from within Ant, the way to up the maximum JVM memory size is
to set environment variable ANT_OPTS to "-XmxSIZE", where SIZE is the 
size you'd like. ANT_OPTS is put on the command line when invoking the JVM.
