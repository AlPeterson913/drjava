/**
 * Keeps track of all listeners to a CompilerModel, and has the ability
 * to notify them of some event.
 *
 * This class has a specific role of managing CompilerListeners.  Other
 * classes with similar names use similar code to perform the same function for
 * other interfaces, e.g. InteractionsEventNotifier and GlobalEventNotifier.
 * These classes implement the appropriate interface definition so that they
 * can be used transparently as composite packaging for a particular listener
 * interface.
 *
 * Components which might otherwise manage their own list of listeners use
 * EventNotifiers instead to simplify their internal implementation.  Notifiers
 * should therefore be considered a private implementation detail of the
 * components, and should not be used directly outside of the "host" component.
 *
 * All methods in this class must use the synchronization methods
 * provided by ReaderWriterLock.  This ensures that multiple notifications
 * (reads) can occur simultaneously, but only one thread can be adding
 * or removing listeners (writing) at a time, and no reads can occur
 * during a write.
 *
 * <i>No</i> methods on this class should be synchronized using traditional
 * Java synchronization!
